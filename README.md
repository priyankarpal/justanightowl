I develop robust back-end applications using Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, and PostgreSQL. also, an open source contributor & projects maintainer at [projectshut](https://github.com/priyankarpal/projectshut) & [reactplay.io](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play). sometimes I write on [hashnode.](https://itspp.hashnode.dev/)

I am currently exploring operating systems, and system designs, focusing on continuous learning and growth.

when I was in high school, developed my first cross-platform app using Flutter & published it to [Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7166668392984578038&gl=US) though the apps are simple, I learned new things that have inspired me a lot to work in tech.

after joining the university I developed a simple web page for a local client(an e-rickshaws store) & earned a few bucks in my freshman year that year I participated first in-person hackathon (MLH powered) with my teammates & we built a full stack-level project. although we didn‘t win, we learned a lot from that hackathon.
