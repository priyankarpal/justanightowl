Hello,I am Priyankar Pal, undergraduate computer science and engineering student from India. I develop robust back-end applications using Nest.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Redis. Also, an open source contributor & projects maintainer at [projectshut](https://github.com/priyankarpal/projectshut) & [reactplay.io](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play). sometimes I share technical blogs on [hashnode.](https://ppal.hashnode.dev/)

I am currently exploring operating systems, and system designs, focusing on continuous learning and growth.

when I was in high school, developed my first cross-platform app using Flutter & published it to [Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7166668392984578038&gl=US) though the apps are simple, I learned new things that have inspired me a lot to work in tech.

after joining the university I developed a simple web page for a local client(an e-rickshaws store) & earned a few bucks in my freshman year. I love to paricipate in hackathons(offline/online) so that year I participated first in-person hackathon (MLH powered) with my teammates & we built a full stack project although we didn‘t win, we learned a lot from that hackathon.
